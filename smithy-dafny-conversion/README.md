## Smithy Dafny Conversion

A Java 8 Library that converts from
idiomatic Java types to Dafny Runtime types and vice versa.
The code generated by `smithy-dafny` will include runtime references to
this library.

This library assumes that Dafny will not introduce breaking changes
to the Dafny Runtime jar inside a major version.
This isn't currently guaranteed by the Dafny implementation,
so this library may need to be updated with each new Dafny release.
