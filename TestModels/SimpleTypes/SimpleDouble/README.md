# SimpleDouble

This project will implement the smithy type [double](https://smithy.io/2.0/spec/simple-types.html#double) and the associated operations in `dafny`.

## Status

This project does not build. Neither the `software.amazon.polymorph.smithydotnet` nor the `software.amazon.polymorph.smithydafny` projects support code generation for the "Double" shape. This project cannot be used to generate the SimpleDouble type for either Dafny or Dotnet.

Once the Polymorph code generators supports code generation for this shape, these files should be extended to complete the type implementation.
