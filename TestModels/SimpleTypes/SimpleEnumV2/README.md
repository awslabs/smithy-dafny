# SimpleEnumV2

This project will implement the Smithy 2.0 type [enum](https://smithy.io/2.0/spec/simple-types.html#enum) and the associated operations in `dafny`.

## Status

This project does not build. The `software.amazon.polymorph` project does not support Smithy version 2.0 models.

Once the project adds Smithy 2.0 support, these files should be extended to allow building EnumV2.
