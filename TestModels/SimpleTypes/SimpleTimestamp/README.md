# SimpleTimestamp

This project will implement the smithy type [timestamp](https://smithy.io/2.0/spec/simple-types.html#timestamp) and the associated operations in `dafny`.

## Status

This project does not build. The `software.amazon.polymorph.smithydafny` project does not support code generation for the "Timestamp" shape.

Once the Polymorph code generator supports code generation for this shape, these files should be extended to complete the type implementation.
