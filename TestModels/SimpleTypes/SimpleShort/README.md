# SimpleShort

This project will implement the smithy type [short](https://smithy.io/2.0/spec/simple-types.html#short) and the associated operations in `dafny`.

## Status

This project does not build for Dotnet. The `software.amazon.polymorph.smithydotnet` project does not support the "Short" shape.

Once Smithy Dotnet supports code generation for this shape, these files should be extended to complete the type implementation.
