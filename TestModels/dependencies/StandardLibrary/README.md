# DafnyLib

The contents in this directory are currently a subset copies of [StandardLibrary](https://github.com/ShubhamChaturvedi7/private-aws-encryption-sdk-dafny-staging/tree/v4-seperate-modules/StandardLibrary) and [libraries](https://github.com/dafny-lang/libraries/tree/b9bc1781e07210e66c3ba9deeff81e73937a921c) merged together. These should be replaced
with published libraries as Dafny gets project files
and these specific modules are published.

The main file to include would be `src/Index.dfy` which in turn refers to all the dafny modules in the directory.
