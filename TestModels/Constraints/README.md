# SimpleConstraints

This project will implements Smithy 1.0 [constraints](https://smithy.io/1.0/spec/core/constraint-traits.html#)  in `dafny`. This is then transpiled to a target runtime, and each tests are executed - either as CI actions or manually.

Right now, this project tests none of the 8 Smithy 1.0 constraint traits. `smithy-dotnet` currently does not generate validation code for any traits other than the `@required` trait. 

Once `smithy-dotnet` adds generation for other traits, we should extend this project to test the other traits.

## Build

### All target runtimes
1. Generate Dafny code using `polymorph`
```
make polymorph_dafny
```

### .NET
1. Generate the Wrappers using `polymorph`
```
make polymorph_dotnet
```

2. Transpile the tests (and implementation) to the target runtime.
```
make transpile_net
```

3. Generate the executable in the .NET and execute the tests
```
make test_net
```

## Development
1. To add another target runtime support, edit the `Makefile` and add the appropriate recipe to generate the `polymorph` wrappers, and dafny transpilation.
2. Provide any glue code between dafny and target runtime if required.
3. Build, execute, and test in the target runtime.

*Example*

`--output-dotnet <PATH>` in the `gradlew run` is used to generate the polymorph wrappers. Similarly `--compileTarget:<RUNTIME>` flags is used in dafny recipe to transpile to C#.
