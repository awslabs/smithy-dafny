# AWS-SDK-SQS

TODO: Test for dafny-client-codegen Smithy plugin.

## Build

Building a typescript client for SQS:

```
gradle build
```

The generated client package will appear in `build/smithyprojections/typescript-codegen`.

## Development

To implement https://github.com/awslabs/polymorph/issues/151, we want to provide a similar
"dafny-client-codegen" Smithy plugin that can be configured in smithy-build.json as well.
