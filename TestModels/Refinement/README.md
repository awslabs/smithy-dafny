# SimpleRefinement

This project test the smithy behavior trait [readonly](https://smithy.io/1.0/spec/core/behavior-traits.html#readonly-trait) for the `polymorph_dafny` generated code. The `readonly` trait on a smithy operation that transalates to a `function method` in dafny. This means it can have only single expression. The project also tests `inputOnly`, `outputOnly` along with the base operation `getRefinement`. The project is then transpiled to a target runtime, and each tests are executed - either as CI actions or manually.

## Build
### .NET
1. Generate the Wrappers using `polymorph`
```
make polymorph_dafny polymorph_dotnet
```

2. Transpile the tests (and implementation) to the target runtime.
```
make transpile_net
```

3. Generate the executable in the .NET and execute the tests
```
make test_net
```

## Development
1. To add another target runtime support, edit the `Makefile` and add the appropriate recipe to generate the `polymorph` wrappers, and dafny transpilation.
2. Provide any glue code between dafny and target runtime if required.
3. Build, execute, and test in the target runtime.

*Example*

`--output-dotnet <PATH>` in the `gradlew run` is used to generate the polymorph wrappers. Similarly `--compileTarget:<RUNTIME>` flags is used in dafny recipe to transpile to C#.
